  The navbar is the foundation for the various menus used at Länsförsäkringar.
  As each channel/system has its own need from a menu it is however always
  modified for that environment.

      ## How to use


      The navbar differs from our other components in that it is a foundation to
      build on, rather than a set design. If you're designing on a system level
      and need a new menu, use the navbar as your starting point and then adapt
      it to what suits your environment.


      ### Versions


      We have two versions of our navbar; blue and white. Technically you could
      use any colour combination you want, but using other colours than blue and
      white should only be done as a last resort.


      #### Blue navbar


      The blue navbar should only be used for customer-facing
      systems/applications, and when in use it should be the main menu.


      #### White navbar


      The white navbar is used as a secondary menu (like the "personal menu" on
      Mina Sidor) or in internal systems.


      ### Modifiers


      A number of modifiers exist for the navbar, and except for direction they
      are all on/off, meaning that you can combine them freely.


      #### Direction


      Your navbar can be either vertical or horizontal. Which one to choose
      depends on the rest of your layout and preferred behaviour of your menu:


      * Horizontal: Good for either very small applications or large ones. Small
      one applications lets you click the link and you're there. In large
      application/sites the horizontal menu serves well as the basis for a mega
      menu (like on [lansforsakringar.se](https://www.lansforsakringar.se)).

      * Vertical: Great for responsive views and for mid-sizes applications. It
      lets the users either find their way to a category page and navigate
      within the content or to dig deeper by clicking the chevron on the right
      hand side of the text. The vertical menu is always placed on the left hand
      side.


      #### Logotype


      If you wish, you can add a logotype in the first part of the menu.


      #### Icons


      The menu items may have an icon in front of them. If you choose to use
      icons, have an icon in front of every item on that level.


      #### Size


      There are three sizes available for the navbar; standard, small and extra
      small. They can all be used, but recommended usage is as follows:


      * Normal size with horizontal direction

      * Small size with vertical direction

      * Extra small for pop-out menus

      ## How to use


      Navbars require a wrapping`.navbar`with optional classes for color schema,
      directions and sizes.


      ```

      <nav class="navbar *"></nav>

      ```


      ### Variants


      There is two different color schemas of the navbar **blue** and **white**.
      Without any modifier the blue color schema will be used.


      To use the **white** variant add **.**`navbar-light` to `.navbar`

       

      ```

      <nav class="navbar navbar-light"></nav>

      ```




      #### Modifiers


      A number of modifiers exist for the navbar, and except for direction they
      are all on/off, meaning that you can combine them freely.


      ##### Direction


      By default navbar is horizontal. If you want it vertical instead use
      `.navbar-stacked. `


      ```

      <nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-stacked"></nav>

      ```


      Vertical navbar also comes with support for a second level inside your
      navigation. Functionality for the button toggle **is not** part of LFUI,
      you have to build that yourself.


      ```

      <nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-stacked">
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Home</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item has-sub open">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Features</a>
            <button type="button" role="button" class="navbar-toggle" aria-expanded="true"></button>
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Home</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item has-sub open">
                <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Features</a>
                <button type="button" role="button" class="navbar-toggle" aria-expanded="true"></button>
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                  <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Home</a>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Pricing</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">Pricing</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>

      ```


      ##### Size


      You have the option to change size of the navbar. LFUI comes with two
      modifiers to do so `.navbar-sm` and `.navbar-xs` Both will make the
      padding and font size smaller.


      ```

      <nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-stacked navbar-sm"></nav>

      ```


      ##### Icons


      You have the option to use icons for each item in a navbar. Use any of the
      32px Icons LFUI provide. If you are using a size modifier `.navbar-sm` or
      `.navbar-xs ` use a 20px icon instead.


      ```
       <nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-stacked">
         <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
          <li class="nav-item active">
            <a class="nav-link" href="#trolol">
              <svg class="navbar-icon" width="32" height="32">
                <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#icon-navigation-home-32"></use>
              </svg>
              Home
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
       </nav>
      ```


      ### Accessibility


      Make sure you include relevant accessibility markup. In order to have the
      buttons and links have the proper styling, add the `role="button` to
      the`.nav-toggle` and `.nav-link`-elements.


      *"When using button classes on`<a>`elements that are used to trigger
      in-page functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to
      new pages or sections within the current page, these links should be given
      a `role="button"` to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive
      technologies such as screen readers."*


      ### Please consider


      At the moment navbar is not adjusted to responsive design. That's
      something you have to build yourself. There is a couple of modifiers
      available in
      [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) that can
      get you started.
