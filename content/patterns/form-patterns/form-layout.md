intro: This page describes general rule of thumbs to consider when designing a
  form. However, remember that they are rules of thumb and not strict rules. You
  need to consider how your specific form can be displayed in the best fashion
  possible.

At the bottom of this page you will find an illustrative image which exemplifies all our rules of thumb. The rules of thumb are:

* Use the grid
* Do not place more than two elements next to each other (neighbouring elements)
* Size of the element shows the expected length of input
* Create clusters of related information

Below you can find the rules of thumb explained in greater detail. For information on how to put the various form elements together, refer to [Form element grouping.](form-element-grouping)

## Use the grid

When placing your elements, make sure to follow [our design dimensions](/visual-identity/design-dimensions) (the grid).

## Neighbouring elements 

It is often a good idea to put two different input elements next to each other to give a more compact feeling to the form. The items should have a natural connection to each other, like postal number and postal address in the example image below. Make sure to not put more than two items next to each other however as it decreases readability of the form drastically and makes it more difficult to know in which order to fill it out.

## Size shows expected content length

When designing a form, use the length of the element to give the user an idea of expected length of the input. If it only is a few characters (like postal number in the image below), make the input element short and let the adjacent one be bigger (like postal address below).

## Create clusters of related information

To make longer forms easier to fill out and more intelligible to users, make sure to create clusters of input elements. In longer forms (like the one depicted below), it is common to use [panels](/components/web/page-content/panel) as a way of creating visually distinct clusters. As an added bonus, the panel provides you with headings so you can inform the user in advance what the cluster contains.
