## How to use

Graphs are used to visualize data and to help people quickly understand and use information that are too numerous or complicated to be described adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however, use graphs for small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.

Drawing and presenting data visually in graphs, charts, diagrams or even maps are powerful tools which help the user understand and comprehend the data more intuitively. When dealing with shares, funds, money and other more or less "complicated" bank matters, visualizing the data is often recommended.

### Type of graph

There are different kind of graphs to use, here comes some way of thinking wen to use them:

#### . . . a Line Graph

Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time.

#### . . . a Pie Chart.

Pie charts are best to use when you are trying to compare parts of a whole. They do not show changes over time.

#### . . . a Bar Graph.

Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track changes over time. However, bar graphs are best when the changes are larger.

#### . . . an Area Graph.

Area graphs are very similar to line graphs. They can be used to track changes over time for one or more groups. Use area charts only if you want to show how values develop over time.

#### . . . an X-Y Plot.

X-Y plots are used to determine relationships between the two different things. The x-axis is used to measure one event (or variable) and the y-axis is used to measure the other. If both variables increase at the same time, they have a positive relationship. If one variable decreases while the other increases, they have a negative relationship. Sometimes the variables don't follow any pattern and have no relationship.

#### . . . a Map Chart.

Use a map if you have data with a geographical component. Maps can shade areas in proportion to mapped values, allowing for visual pop-out of high-value areas. Data for map charts must contain geographical names corresponding to the geographical entities represented on the map.

### The different parts

#### Legends

Important to each graphical element is a legend describing the visual data. The legends should be 16x16 pixels, with text in Arial that describes the legend.

Position-wise, they should be in close relation to the graph itself. Prefereble on the right or under the graph.

#### Interactivity

If the graph/chart has interactivity attached to it. Click on the legends to highlight the different parts in the graph. Even the text of the legend should be clickable.

#### Color

LFUI provides a few scales to choose from that will color your visual data according to the visual profile of Länsförsäkringar. The visual identity set a preferable scale of blue or red. Below we have set different set to make it the same for all graphs. Use colors to make your most important value stand out

We are going to update the colors for better accessibility. \[2019-12-01]

Here are the latest sets of colors to use:

* Blue colors - 10 colors
* Red colors - 10 colors
* Blue to red - 16 colors
* Red to blue - 16 colors
* Hybrid - 4 colors
* Map - 15 colors
* Disabled / not selected / inactive color is grey #d9d9d9 (smoke).

#### Accessibility

Charts, graphs and maps use visuals to convey complex images to users. But since they are images, these media provide serious accessibility issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. 

Generally speaking an ALT tag cannot do justice to a complex chart. One way to describe a chart is to provide both a text summary and a properly coded data table near the chart.

This serves multiple audiences because a chart can show trends, but a table can provide exact data for those who are interested.
