## Getting started

### Installation

`$ npm install --save-dev https://github.com/lf-digitala-kanaler/LFUI.git#release/6.5.0`

The end of the command above is pointing towards a specific branch, in this case our latest release`6.5.0`-branch. You can alter this number to point at the branch/release of your choice.

When LFUI reaches a new release and you want to update your local installation of LFUI, you can do so by pointing at the new release branch by **editing your package.json** like the example above and running

### Updates

When LFUI reaches a new release and you want to update your local installation of LFUI, you can do so by pointing at the new release branch by **editing your package.json** like the example above and running

`$ npm install lfui`

### Releases

LFUI is in constant development, hence new releases are scheduled on continuous basis.

## LFUI usage

In the /dist folder you will find:

* lf.css
* lf.js
* Icons
* Fonts

These files are built/compiled from the project's source files and assets. They can be used as is. Simply add jQuery, `lf.js` and `lf.css` to your document.

### In your build

If you, however, wish to include LFUI in you build, take note to:

* Use your preferred task runner (such as[](https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-postcss) [Gulp](https://github.com/postcss/gulp-postcss) or plain [npm scripts](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/))

  * See [package.json](https://lf-digitala-kanaler.github.io/LFUI/650/package.json) for an example how the dist files are built
* Add prefixes using a library such as [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* Take appropriate measures to ensure that no SCSS-file is imported more than once, we recommend [node-sass-import-once](https://github.com/at-import/node-sass-import-once)

Import [LFUI.scss](https://lf-digitala-kanaler.github.io/LFUI/650/src/scss/LFUI.scss) in the very beginning of your main SCSS file (often index.scss or main.scss):
