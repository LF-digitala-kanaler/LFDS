        title: 1.01 - Arrange content in a clear and meaningful hierarchy
        text: >
          Think about how you can arrange content in a meaningful order, so that
          the user can easily follow the flow through the information. Avoid
          filling all available space. Unused space (white space) is important
          in order to not overwhelm the user with visuals and letting the eyes
          rest.


          Make sure there is a clear hierarchy and that elements do not compete for attention. By doing so, you help the user to be naturally drawn to important information and interactions.

        title: 1.02 - Be consistent with navigation, structure and design
        text: >-
          Some users memorize the structure in order to understand the content
          and how the site functions. When content and functions are not
          consistent it can be difficult for the user to interpret the content
          and navigate the site. Therefore, follow a common site structure for
          all pages. Not all pages need to look exactly the same but they should
          follow the same general structure. 


          Functions should be performed the same way regardless of where on the website the user is located. The same rule of consistency applies to names and appearance of functions. For example, a button called “approve” should not be called “OK” on a different page. A “save” icon should have the same appearance everywhere.

        title: 1.03 - Present content correctly regardless of screen orientation
        text: >-
          #### For designers 


          Not all people have the ability or possibility to rotate the screen. Some have to choose between portrait or landscape and stick with it, for example when the screen is mounted on a wheelchair. Therefore, design content and functions that are accessible regardless of screen orientation. The user should be able to choose orientation after personal preference.


          #### For testers


          * Test the reading order of the page by going through it on different screen sizes.

          * Also test it with a screen reader, for example VoiceOver on an iPhone.

          * Make sure to test the flow of the page in other documents (pdf, word, etc.). See also section 2.15.

        title: 1.04 - All important information should be available to all users
        text: >-
          Hiding important information in PDFs decreases searchability and makes
          it harder for the user to get an overview of the content. Find a
          balance between presenting information on the web versus keeping it in
          downloadable documents.


          As much as possible, critical information should be available on the web. Make sure to divide the content into relevant pages so you avoid walls of texts.

        text: >-
          A screen or a window should be able to present a page at 320 pixels
          width without side-scrolling.


          * Use primarily responsive design 

          * When creating responsive design is not possible, create a custom mobile version. 

          * PDF:s and other downloadables  should work the same way.

          Not all people are able or willing to call a company for help. Some
          may have trouble communicating in writing. Reasons for this can range
          from a physical or cognitive disability to simply being
          unfamiliar  with the language. Give people the option to choose a
          method they are comfortable with. Avoid only having a phone number.
          Always provide a phone number and an email address whenever possible.


          In some cases you may only be able to provide one option. In that case, think about how you can reduce the need for contact. One solution could be answering the most common questions in a “frequently asked questions” section.

        title: "1.07 - The design should pass contrast 5:1 "
        text: >-
          Contrast varies depending on the size of text and icons. Create
          designs the user can zoom in on, in order to see better. Components
          and text should pass a contrast ratio of 5:1 and you can test this
          with automatic tests. Yes, the WCAG 2.1 recommendation is a ratio of
          minimum of 4.5:1, but we’ve rounded it up. It’s easier to remember and
          gives us a little extra margin.


          You can check contrast on a page here: [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)


          Try passing the contrast level by a good margin. The components in our library should follow these recommendations. If you find a component that isn’t up to standard, contact us.


          There are cases where a component could have a contrast above 5:1 but still be illegible or difficult to interpret. Therefore don’t assume automatic tests are 100% correct, use your own judgement.

          important information and interactions. Use our red color (#E30613)
          sparingly, for example when you need a “call-to-action” button.

        text: >-
          Content that appears when the user focuses on it with the keyboard or
          mouse should be accessible and controllable for all users. This
          includes users that zoom in on a page or take their time to get to the
          content. It is especially important that users are able to close or
          remove the pop-up content.


          Examples of such content can be sub-menus, tool-tips or non-modal pop-ups.

          it easier for users with writing or typing difficulties. It also saves
          time and simplifies the process for all other users.


          For performance and efficiency reasons, wait until the user enters two characters in the search field before presenting suggestions.

          read text on images. If you do have text in an image and the text is
          highly relevant to the user, make sure the text is included in the
          alt-text.

        title: 1.12 - Use “alt-text” on images containing important information
        text: >-
          Images included in the design for more than just decoration (graphs or
          diagrams) need to have an alternative-text. The user should be able to
          understand what the image conveys even if the image is not visible
          because of a bad connection, the image link is broken or the user is
          using a screen reader.

          One good way of doing this is describing the image the same way you would do it in a phone conversation.


          If a CMS system is being used, make it easier for the editors by making the alt-text field  mandatory.

          communicate important information to the user. However, an empty
          alt-tag is still needed in order for the page to validate.

        title: 1.15 - Let the user navigate in the way they are most comfortable with
        text: >-
          People prefer to navigate the web differently, based on either
          personal preference or disability. Therefore, we offer several ways to
          navigate our website.


          Consider user needs and the complexity of the site when choosing ways to navigate.


          Possible functions could be a search function, main menu, in-page navigation, support for tab navigation or traversing through links. 


          Focus on helping the user to their goal. For example, when a user uses the search bar, help the user get to the results quicker by skipping the menu.


          Some navigation aids use only links or headlines to navigate.

          Users that navigate with the tab-key need to clearly see which element
          is in focus by seeing a surrounding border. The standard border is
          often a thin, dashed line that can be difficult to discern, especially
          if the surroundings are busy or the contrast between elements is low.


          Make the border clearly visible by using a CSS-rule.

        title: 1.18 - Avoid sudden changes when focusing on elements
        text: >-
          To the extent it is possible, make interactions predictable and avoid
          introducing new fields or interactions when the user focuses or
          interacts with an element. 


          You can also prepare the user for the change by using copy or icons. For example, a link to an external site should have an icon that signals that the site will be opened in a new tab.


          Sometimes you may need to include a sudden change in focus. An example of this could be when a user answers a question in a form, and you need a  contextual, follow-up question to


          appear. In that case, make sure the user takes notice of the change by having the new question appear in close proximity and directly after the previous question.

        title: 1.19 - Offer alternatives to more complex gestures
        text: Swiping and gestures that require use of multiple fingers (such as
          pinching) can be difficult to perform for people with reduced motor or
          cognitive function. Some users may also be unable to perform them
          because of the navigation aids they’re using or simply because the
          interactions aren’t immediately obvious. Avoid therefore having
          complex gestures as the primary or most discoverable way to perform
          crucial tasks. This includes tasks like paying bills, transferring
          money or cancelling a debit card. They should be doable with simpler,
          easy to discover interactions, such as single tap, double tap or
          press.

        text: >-
          **Tables can be tricky to read, especially for users with screen
          readers. Let the html-code define the different parts of a table and
          how they are connected. For example, use th-elements to define which
          cells are rows and which are columns.**


          The attribute “scope” on a th-element creates a connection between header cells and data cells.This enables the screen reader to read the associated header before the content in a data cell. Doing so relieves  the user from having to remember the table structure. This is especially important for tables with many columns or with several header levels.

          languages where the reading order is the right to left.


          Left-align also the text in main menus and other vertical menus. It will make it easier for the user to browse the menu items, since the user’s eyes can wander along the left edge of the menu.

          the content. Structure headlines according to their level in the
          hierarchy. The most important headline is H1 and the least important
          is H6.  Jumping over levels can be confusing for some navigation aids,
          so make sure an H1 is followed by and H2. You can jump over levels if
          the page is divided into sections (see following example).

          Users with dyslexia or of limited vision need to be able to adjust the
          spacing between paragraphs, rows, words and characters for
          readability. Make it possible for the user to adjust spacing without
          content or functionality clashing or hiding behind other content.


          The user, at minimum, should be able to increase distance at the following relative thresholds:


          * Line spacing to 1,5 times the size of the font

          * Character spacing to 0,12 times the size of the font

          * Word spacing to 0,16 times the size of the font

          * Paragraph spacing to 2 times the size of the font

        text: >-
          When creating accessible PDF:s, do the accessibility adjustments in
          the original document (perhaps in Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign).
          Otherwise you’ll have to adjust the settings in Acrobat Professional,
          which may not be accessible to you. Here are some basic guidelines:




          * The file should have coded tags in a tag tree. You can create a tag tree in Word by selecting “Document structure tags for accessibility”. You can also do it after the conversion to PDF by selecting “Add tags to document” in Acrobat. 

          * Tag headlines with headline tags `<h1>`, `<h2>`, tables `<table>`, table headlines `<th>`, columns `<colgroup>`, bullet point lists `<l>` and table of contents `<toc>`.

          * Add alt-text tags to images, diagrams and image-based figures.

          * Define the reading order. Normally it should be set to “Use document structure”.

          * Include the document title and the name of the author. The option is available under “Document properties”. You can also define the language there. Intermixed text written in a different language should have it’s own language code.

          * Create a table of contents for longer documents, preferably in the form of bookmarks in the PDF. Click the bookmark symbol to edit bookmarks in Acrobat.

          * Make sure copying the document is allowed. You can select the option under security settings. If you still need to to lock the document, check the option for making it available to screen readers.

          * If the document becomes too large after adding the settings, you can always compress it later.

          An exception when a disabled button can be used is during the choice of payment methods in our purchase flows. In this example, the option “Månad” is clickable when the customer chooses “Autogiro”, but not when “Faktura” is chosen.

          Example 1:

        title: "5.03 - Use animations sparingly "
        text: Before you create an animation, you should define a purpose for it. For
          example, the animation will guide the user, direct their attention to
          a piece of information or provide feedback. Animations can also be
          used to add visual flair to a design. Generally, the animations should
          be kept short and non-looping. Users with ADHD may find looping
          animations to be confusing and distracting. Since animations should
          not be looping, they also should not be critical to functionality.

          content. It ranges from a hearing disability, noisy environment
          or  the need to watch without disturbing others. Users for whom
          Swedish isn't their first language sometimes use subtitles as support.

          Structure is everything when you present content to users with
          navigational aids. Valid and semantic HTML makes the structure of the
          content presentable in a meaningful way. CSS, written for
          accessibility makes the web site easier to consume for all users.
          Correctly written CSS can also be used to provide extra information
          that isn’t visible to screen readers. 


           


          * Use HTML5.

          * For presentation and layout with style templates, use CSS. Separate content


          from design - use external style sheets to control presentation and layout. 


          * Create layouts with h-elements. See [2.07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNRR5bo-1oTHdxEB5_Em9pSiYxWieWlg3RosTJjUfAk/edit#heading=h.b5y55cs9w05c)

          * Use the correct h-element when creating lists.

          * Make sure input fields match their connected label elements. Create clear and clickable field labels. See also [4.01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNRR5bo-1oTHdxEB5_Em9pSiYxWieWlg3RosTJjUfAk/edit#heading=h.q4tgchlrp7bw)

          * Add headings to tables See [1.20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNRR5bo-1oTHdxEB5_Em9pSiYxWieWlg3RosTJjUfAk/edit#heading=h.h3g84f8san64) for more details.

          * Mark mandatory input fields in a form. See also [4.08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNRR5bo-1oTHdxEB5_Em9pSiYxWieWlg3RosTJjUfAk/edit#heading=h.6oh083uibybu)

          * Emphasize content with the element “em” and not just italic, since italics can’t be read by a screen reader. 

          * Use WAI-ARIA for elements that can't be expressed with regular HTML.

          * För subscription services, use RSS eller Atom.Make it possible to subscribe to information.

        text: >-
          For users navigating with a screen reader, tabbing, or other aids it
          may take a while to get through a menu. In addition, when content is
          repeated on several pages it adds additional  mental strain on the
          user. Physical pain can become an issue if the same movement needs to
          be repeated over and over. Therefore, you should always offer the
          option to skip repeating content.


          * Create shortcuts so that users can, for example, skip menus and get to the content immediately.

          * Create headlines with h-elements, since screen readers allow users to navigate faster using headlines. 

          * Use  WAI-ARIA landmark roles, for example main, search, navigation, banner, contentinfo etc. This helps users with screen readers navigate between different sections of the page in a standardized manner.

          * Use structure elements like “main”, “aside”, “header”, “footer” and “nav” to define roles for each section of the page. 

          * R68. Create shortcuts as necessary.

          a purchase, you may need to inform the user that they’ll lose progress
          if they go backwards. This is OK, as long as the user understands the
          consequences. If you’re creating an SPA-app this has to be resolved
          programmatically.

        title: 7.04 - Create shortcuts with care
        text: >-
          Shortcuts can make navigating through a website faster but they should
          be used with care.


          There is a risk that the websites’ short cuts could be confused with the shortcuts of the browser, operative system or navigation aid. In addition, short cuts that consist of only one key press can cause problems for users with limited motoric skills or users using voice navigation.




          * Use shortcuts sparingly. Ask yourself, why do you need them, and what function do they provide that doesn’t already exist?

          * Use well-established key combinations, so long they don’t clash with browser’s shortcuts.

          * Inform the user which shortcuts are available to them.

          * Provide the option to turn off or change shortcuts that consist of only one key press.

        title: 7.05 - Make sure the code validates
        text: >-
          There are several aids that can make it easier for developers to
          follow standards.


          **Code validation** 


          Validating the code helps you find errors that can be hard to discover on your own. It could ID’s with non-unique values, fields with missing labels or errors in the html code.


          If you want to validate a local page, you can copy/paste the code or download a plugin for your browser.


          [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)




          **Validate accessibility**


          Chrome has a built-in validation for accessibility in its development tools. If you wish to go to a  bit more detailed level, you can download a plugin called “Axe” for Chrome. You can use it straight from the developer tools menu. 


          * Verify that your function templates, services and style templates validate in accordance with the HTML 5 standard.

          * Try automating a recurring code validation, or create a validation routine procedure when changes to the website code occur. It is easy for previously correct code to become invalid. This could happen when a plugin is updated, a media player is inserted in a blog post, or when someone creates a post in a comment hosting service.

        title: 7.06 - Make sure page speed is up to standard
        text: >-
          A part of great usability is a page that loads quickly, minimising the
          wait times and avoiding shifting elements as the page loads. Users
          today expect a page to be loaded and ready for navigation within 3
          seconds. Some images can be loaded afterwards, but in general it is
          difficult for the user to navigate a page if the content constantly
          shifts because of long loading times.




          It’s especially difficult for visually impared users, as they may have a hard time noticing content that is still loading.


          #### When is the page speed good enough?


          Research has shown that users lose concentration if they have to wait too long. Nielsen-Norman have documented the following [consequences of web response times](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/):


          * At 0,1 seconds the user no longer feels the system responds instantaneously   

          * At 1 second response time the user’s flow of thought is being hindered by the waiting.

          * At 10 seconds the user finds it very difficult to stay focused on the task and wants to do something else while waiting.

          them and present them to the user at an appropriate time.
