      ## How to use


      Buttons are in their essence a form of link which helps the user through a
      specific flow, typical examples are progressing to the next page or
      submitting something. They are also used as a way of entering a specific
      flow. Through their visual presence they give the users queues on what
      expected actions exist.


      The responsive rules for our buttons transform them the full row-width in
      smaller screens. This should be your default design, but feel free to put
      two buttons next to each other even in smaller screens if the context
      makes it a better choice. 


      <figure class="Image none"><img src="/img/responsive-button.jpg"
      alt=""><figcaption><div
      class="Image__caption"></div></figcaption></figure>
