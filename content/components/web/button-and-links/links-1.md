      ## How to use


      Links is the main way of helping users find information which isn't
      included in the current page/view. Examples of where links can lead are
      another page on our webpage, a pdf with more info or a link to an external
      webpage. 


      ### Versions


      We have two versions of links; primary and regular. However, headings can
      also be links (especially on [cards](../page-content/card)) - this use
      case is described under [Headings in Typography.](../typography/headings)


      #### Primary links


      Primary links are used for highlighting a link which you want to put extra
      emphasis on. Examples include repeating a [primary
      button](buttons-1#primary-buttons) further down in the page (a pattern
      which can often be seen on lansforsakringar.se) or as part of a [call
      out](../page-content/callout). 


      As they are primary there can only be one primary link per block (and
      preferably page). Layout-wise the primary link is rather "heavy" with an
      arrow after the text, meaning it should be used sparsely. 


      <div class="Callout"><div class="Callout__icon"></div><p
      class="Callout__text"><strong>Link or button? </strong>The first time you
      show a link in a page you might want to use a primary button instead to
      give extra emphasis to the link, especially at the top of pages. The
      further down you are, the better it is to use link-styling.</p></div>


      #### Regular links


      Our regular link follows web standards closely, being blue with and
      underlined. On hover it changes colour to a darker shade of blue.
      Depending on in which context it is used there are some aspects to
      consider.


      ##### Inline in text


      If you want to include a link in in a block text, you may do so but do it
      with caution. Links in text is good from an SEO-perspective but bad from a
      accesibility-perspective. If you want to include a link inline keep the
      paragraph it is in as short as possible. If you have several links you
      want to add, you should consider a [link list](#link-list) instead.


      ###### In a bullet list


      If you want to use a link in a bullet list, make sure to formulate the
      content is such a way that you can put the link at the end of the bullet
      point.


      ##### Link list


      If we have several links which we want to group together, they are placed
      in a link list. The link list exist in two versions:


      * Without icons - for links within the system.

      * With icons - for lists with documents. The icons identify which kind of
      file or link it is. A typical example is when we want to present terms and
      "förköpsinformation" in a purchase flow. If this version is used all links
      should have an icon (please see [external links in
      lists](#external-links-in-lists) as well).


      ##### External links


      If your link leads away from the context you're in the link should be
      amended with an external link icon. This includes changing technical
      environment within Länsförsäkringar's world (like a link in Mina Sidor or
      a purchase flow leading to lansforsakringar.se ). The icon should come
      after the link text and links should open in a new tab/window (depending
      on the user's browser settings).


      ###### External links in lists


      An exception to the above way of handling external links is when they are
      in a list. As the other links have icons in front of them, the external
      links also have the icon in front of the text to create a more coherent
      visual experience.


      ##### Paired with a button


      A common usage of the regular link is as a secondary option in a flow. In
      this case the link contrasts a primary button. Depending on what the link
      does, it is either placed to the far left in height with the primary
      button (for "backwards"-functionality) or just prior the primary button
      (for "cancel"-functionality). The image below shows one of the rare cases
      where both options exist.
