      ## How to use


      Links is the main way of helping users find information which isn't
      included in the current page/view. Examples of where links can lead are
      another page on our webpage, a pdf with more info or a link to an external
      webpage. 


      ### Versions


      We have two main versions of links; primary and secondary. 


      #### Primary links


      Primary links are used for highlighting a link which you want to put extra
      emphasis on. Examples include repeating a [primary
      button](../buttons-1#primary-buttons) further down in the page (a pattern
      which can often be seen on lansforsakringar.se) or as part of a [call
      out](../../page-content/callout).


      As they are primary there can only be one primary link per block (and
      preferably page).


      <div class="Callout"><div class="Callout__icon"></div><p
      class="Callout__text"><strong>Link or button? </strong>The first time you
      show a link in a page you might want to use a primary button instead to
      give extra emphasis to the link, especially at the top of pages. The
      further down you are, the better it is to use link-styling.</p></div>
