      ## How to use


      Links is the main way of helping users find information which isn't
      included in the current page/view. Examples of where links can lead are
      another page on our webpage, a pdf with more info or a link to an external
      webpage. 


      ### Versions


      We have two versions of links; primary and regular. However, headings can
      also be links (especially on [cards](../page-content/card)) - this use
      case is described under [Headings in Typography.](../typography/headings)


      #### Primary links


      Primary links are used for highlighting a link which you want to put extra
      emphasis on. Examples include repeating a [primary
      button](buttons-1#primary-buttons) further down in the page (a pattern
      which can often be seen on lansforsakringar.se) or as part of a [call
      out](../page-content/callout). 


      As they are primary there can only be one primary link per block (and
      preferably page). Layout-wise the primary link is rather "heavy" with an
      arrow after the text, meaning it should be used sparsely. 


      <div class="Callout"><div class="Callout__icon"></div><p
      class="Callout__text"><strong>Link or button? </strong>The first time you
      show a link in a page you might want to use a primary button instead to
      give extra emphasis to the link, especially at the top of pages. The
      further down you are, the better it is to use link-styling.</p></div>


      #### Regular links


      Our regular link follows web standards closely, being blue with and
      underlined. On hover it changes colour to a darker shade of blue.
      Depending on in which context it is used there are some aspects to
      consider.
