      ## How to use


      Our checkbox follows standard web behaviour - it is used when the user has
      do to a choice and isn't limited to only one. Not much more to say
      designwise.


      ## Please consider


      If you have more than five options you are probably better off using a
      [multi-select dropdown](../dropdown).
