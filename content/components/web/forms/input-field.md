      ## How to use


      Use an input field when you want the user to enter some information freely
      (use another [form](../) option if they only can select from a set number
      of options). The input field has two companion elements, the label and
      help text (see the [forms landing page](../) for a description of them).


      There are several variations of input field, described below.
