      ## How to use


      Use an input field when you want the user to enter some information freely
      (use another [form](../) option if they only can select from a set number
      of options). The input field has two companion elements, the label and
      help text (see the [forms landing page](../) for a description of them).


      ### Variations


      There are two mains variations of input fields, the one-lined and the one
      spanning over several lines/rows. The one-lined in addition can be
      modified in a number of ways.


      #### One-lined text input


      The one-lined text input field is the most commonly used input type and is
      used when you want a specific input from the user (such as e-mail, a value
      or subject). Depending on context and amount of space available you can
      put either one or two one-lined input fields on a row by using _**the
      grid**_. If you place two input fields on the same row they should have
      the same size. See images below for an example.


      A one-lined text input field on a row


      ![Example of an input field](/img/one-lined-input-field.png "A one-lined
      input field")


      Two one-lined text input fields on a row


      ![Two one-lined input fields on a row with extra
      content](/img/two-one-lined-on-a-row.png "Two one-lined input fields on a
      row")


      #### Modifiers


      The one-lined text input has several modifiers, all described below.

      ##### Datepicker

      Although a form of input field as well from a user perspective, the
      datepicker is treated as a separate component. [Go here](../datepicker) to
      read about it.

      ##### Password

      If an input field contains a password or other sensitive data the please
      use the password modifier. It follows web standards and translates
      characters into asterisks as they are entered.

      ##### Prefix

      If you need to put a label of sorts prior to the actual input area you can
      add the modifier "prefix". It might be usable in a context where the user
      has to enter a twitter handle or URL, but no actual uses of prefix with
      text are known at time of writing. It is however a technical prerequisite
      for the more common "prefix as image". 

      ##### Prefix as image

      A version of prefix where the text has been replaced with an image. The
      most common usage is relation to motor insurances and when users are asked
      to provide the number plate of the vehicle they want to insure/make a
      claim on.

      ##### Suffix

      Adds a label to the end of the input field, most commonly the unit (e.g.
      "kr", "years" and "m²"). 


      #### Text input with several lines (Textarea)


      If you need a text input field which spans several rows you should use the
      textarea-component. It is typically (perhaps exclusively) used for message
      text when the user can write a message to us. Although we set a height
      when the textarea the user can change the height of the textarea within
      its column as is web standard - we have however disabled horisontal
      resizing.

      ## Så skriver vi


      Vi skriver så kort som möjligt och skriver inte ut det som är uppenbart.
      Håll det kort och skriv inte ut onödiga ord som inte behövs för att förstå
      vad som ska fyllas i. Hjälptext används bara om det inte går att beskriva
      enkelt nog i labeln. 


      #### Vanliga labels


      **Text:** Personnummer


      Placeholder: ÅÅMMDD-NNNN (visst är det så?)


      Hjälptext (Länk): Så behandlar v personuppgifter


      **Text**: Namn


      **Text:** Telefonnummer


      **Text:** E-post


      **Text:** Bekräfta e-post


      **Text:** Betalsätt


      **Text:** Jag vill betala varje
