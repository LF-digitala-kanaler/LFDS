      ## How to use


      Use an input field when you want the user to enter some information freely
      (use another [form](../) option if they only can select from a set number
      of options). The input field has two companion elements, the label and
      help text (see the [forms landing page](../) for a description of them).


      ### Variations


      There are several variations of input fields, each is described below.


      #### One-lined


      The one-lined input field is the most commonly used input type and is used
      when you want a specific input from the user (such as e-mail, a value or
      subject). Depending on context and amount of space available you can put
      either one or two one-lined input fields on a row by using _**the grid**_.
      If you place two input fields on the same row they should have the same
      size. See images below for an example.
