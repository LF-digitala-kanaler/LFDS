      ## How to use


      A dropdown provides the user with a number of options from which they are
      to choose one or several just like [radio buttons](../radio-buttons) and
      [checkboxes](../checkbox). That means that you as a designer need to
      decide whether to use a dropdown or radio buttons/checkboxes. As a simple
      rule of thumb, use radio buttons/checkboxes if you a have five or fewer
      options and dropdown if you have six or more. There are however also other
      considerations which can come into play (here is a good and brief [article
      on
      considerations](https://blog.prototypr.io/7-rules-of-using-radio-buttons-vs-drop-down-menus-fddf50d312d1)
      you should take into account).

      ## Please consider


      **Never use this component in other devices than desktop**.  If the user
      is on a mobile or tablet their devices' native select functionality should
      be used for accessibility reasons. It is important that the custom select
      functionality is disabled and instead use the default native select
      element when the user is not using the desktop application. 


      ## Styling


      The LFUI-styling of the dropdown goes beyond standard styling, which makes
      it technically complex and your developer friends need to code the
      dropdown in a somewhat different manner than they are used to.
