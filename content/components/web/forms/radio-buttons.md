      ## How (and when) to use


      There are several components in LFUI based on radio button behaviour
      (choose one and only one option), all with their specific behaviour:


      * **Styled radio buttons** are used when you want to use radio buttons in
      a context outside a form flow or if you want more/need scaled down radio
      buttons than button group. Typical use cases for this is when there are
      four or more options, or the options need to have long labels.

      * **Button group** is our main way of presenting users with an either
      or-choice in a form. They follow radio button behaviour but have a more
      tabby look to them. They should be your default option if there are three
      or less options to choose from.

      * **Radio cards** exist in two sizes and they are used for presenting the
      user with a primary choice for the whole flow. The larger size is used
      when customers choose between versions of a product and the smaller as a
      filter on large lists (typically lists of funds or stocks).


      ### Styled radio buttons


      Our styled radio buttons are based on a standard radio button look and
      only styled to look and feel more like Länsförsäkringar. They are our
      secondary option for radio button behaviour (with Button group being our
      primary) and should normally only be used if:


      1. There are four or more options to choose from

      2. The label text has to be long (sentences rather than words)

      3. If the radio choice is surrounded by a large amount of text
