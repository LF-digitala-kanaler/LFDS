      ## How (and when) to use


      There are several components in LFUI based on radio button behaviour
      (choose one and only one option), all with their specific behaviour:


      * **Styled radio buttons** are used when you want to use radio buttons in
      a context outside a form flow or if you want more scaled down radio
      buttons than button group.

      * **Button group** is our main way of presenting users with an either
      or-choice in a form. They follow radio button behaviour but have a more
      tabby look to them.

      * **Radio cards** exist in two sizes and they are used for presenting the
      user with a primary choice for the whole flow. The larger size is used
      when customers choose between versions of a product and the smaller as a
      filter on large lists (typically lists of funds or stocks).
