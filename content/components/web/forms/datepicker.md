  The datepicker is the input field used when a date is the expected input. It
  is designed so that the user can either choose the date from a calendar or
  enter it manually.

      ## How to use


      Use the datepicker when you want the user to enter a date or time in
      another manner.


      Visually the datepicker looks like a normal input field with a calendar
      icon in right part of the field. Interactionwise a calendar is expanded
      when the clicks anywhere in the input field (including on the calendar
      icon), in which the user can choose the date they wish to choose. If they
      prefer, the input field can also be used to manually enter the date.


      ### Modifiers


      There are a few modifiers available for the datepicker:


      * There is as a version called **timepicker**, which works like the
      datepicker but lets the user choose a time rather than a day

      * You can choose to disabled dates if needed. Examples of use case for
      this are buying an insurance (not possible earlier than today) or doing an
      injury claim (had to happen today or earlier). You can also choose to
      disable a specific time span.


      ## Please consider


      For accessibility reasons the datepicker should be replaced with the
      native solution for date selection in mobile devices. Make sure your
      developers are aware!
