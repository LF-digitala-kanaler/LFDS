When working with forms you need to be aware of more aspects than only the components. Make sure to also read about our [validation rules](/patterns/general-patterns/form-validation) and how we handle required fields in the [patterns](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.app/patterns/general-patterns/form-validation/) section, and about the grid you can use under [visual identity](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.app/visual-identity/).
