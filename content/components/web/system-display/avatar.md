      ## How to use


      Use the avatar to identify a user or other person-like object (i.e.
      business or service desk). The avatar may feature an image or just the
      users initials. Länsförsäkringar are identified by the symbol in logo.


      ## Please consider


      * Avatars are currently only in use in secure messages.

      * A similar function are used as shortcuts in the app for the startpage to
