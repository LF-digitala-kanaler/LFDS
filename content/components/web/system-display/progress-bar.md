      ## How to use


      The progress bar is used to display how much of a flow that has been completed. It's often used for longer flows such as web based educations. In web applications/check outs we usually use  [pagination](/components/web/navigations/pagination), which is our standard way of showing progress in a purchase flow.


      The progress bar consists of a visual indicator and a percentage which shows how large part of the flow which has been completed.


      ## Please consider


      * The progress bar shows how much of the flow which has been completed, meaning that you (hypothetically) can have completed 78% and be on page 2 of 7. In contrast, the pagination only tells you on which page you are without taking into account how much of the flow you have completed.

      * Usage together with arrow step navigation is encouraged.
