      ## How to use


      The progress bar is used to display how much of a flow that has been
      completed. It's often used for longer flows such as web based educations.
      In web applications/check outs we usually use the component
      [pagination](../../navigations/pagination/) witch are our standard way of
      showing progress in a buying flow context.


      The progress bar consists of a visual indicator and a percentage which
      shows how large part of the flow which has been completed.


      ## Please consider


      * The progress bar shows how much of the flow which has been completed,
      meaning that you (hypothetically) can have completed 78% and be on page 2
      of 7. In contrast, the pagination only tells you on which page you are
      without taking into account how much of the flow you have completed.

      * Usaged together with arrow step navigation is encouraged.
