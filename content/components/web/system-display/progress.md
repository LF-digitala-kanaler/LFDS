  preferred.

      ## How to use


      The progress bar is used to display how much of a flow has been completed.
      It is used for longer flows, as
      [pagination](../../navigations/pagination/) is our standard way of showing
      progress in a flow.


      The progress bar consists of a visual indicator and a percentage which
      shows how large part of the flow which has been completed.


      ## Please consider


      The progress bar shows how much of the flow which has been completed,
      meaning that you (hypothetically) can have completed 78% and be on page 2
      of 7. In contrast, the pagination only tells you on which page you are
      without taking into account how much of the flow you have completed.
