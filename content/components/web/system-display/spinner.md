      ## How to use


      Use the spinner when you expect that the user will have to wait for all
      data to be loaded or the server to respond. The spinner is the option to
      be used when this situation happens in the main page content. Please look
      at button with spinner ([primary](../button-and-links/buttons) /
      [secondary](../button-and-links/secondary-button)) if you want a loading
      state upon the user submitting data or [panel with lazy
      load](../page-content/panel#modifiers) if the data being loaded is in a
      panel. 


      ### Versions


      The main version of the spinner consists of a circle alternating between
      our blue and red colours on a white background. You should strive towards
      using this version of the spinner, but be aware that it requires a white
      background to look good (for code reasons).


      For other backgrounds than white we have a version with the red colour and
      negative space completing the circle. This version is however rarely used
      as a stand-alone (but it forms the basis for spinner in a button).


      ### Modifiers


      Both versions of the spinner come in three sizes; default, small and extra
      small. As the naming suggests, default is the standard and the other two
      should be used only if the default is too large for your context.


      ## Please note


      * The spinner is the loader to be used in a main field, and there are
      loader versions for buttons and panels.

      ## How to use


      To use the spinner, add a wrapper div where you wish to place the spinner
      and add the relevant class from the choices below to the wrapper. Then,
      place the svg code from the examples below inside the wrapper.


      ### Versions


      There is two versions of of our spinner you can use. Both comes with the
      same modifiers.


      #### Default


      This is the "default" look of the spinner, and can be easily created by
      using the class `.lf-spinner` on the wrapping div.


      ```

      <div class="lf-spinner">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 105 105" x="0" y="0" role="animation">
          <circle class="static-circle" r="45%" cx="50%" cy="50%"></circle>
          <circle class="lf-spinner-dash" r="45%" cx="50%" cy="50%"></circle>
          <line class="lf-spinner-back-line" x1="50%" y1="50%" x2="100%" y2="50%"></line>
          <line class="lf-spinner-forward-line" x1="50%" y1="50%" x2="100%" y2="50%"></line>
        </svg>
      </div>

      ```


      ##### Modifiers


      `.lf-spinner-sm` - change size to 40px


      `.lf-spinner-xs` - change size to 25px


      #### Red


      This is the alternative look of the spinner, and can be easily created by
      using the class`.lf-spinner-neg`on the wrapping div.


      ```

      <div class="lf-spinner-neg">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 105 105" x="0" y="0" role="animation">
          <circle class="static-circle" r="45%" cx="50%" cy="50%"></circle>
          <circle class="lf-spinner-dash" r="45%" cx="50%" cy="50%"></circle>
        </svg>
      </div>

      ```


      ##### Modifiers


      `.lf-spinner-neg-sm` - change size to 40px


      `.lf-spinner-neg-xs` - change size to 25px


      ## Notes


      IE11 and below is unable to animate svgs with css, which is unfortunatley
      exactly what is going on behind the hull of our Spinner. Our fallback here
      is to draw out the svg and simply only rotate it, which works well. The
      biggest issue is the two white divider lines inside the default spinner,
      which can not be correctly placed in IE... without javascript.


      If you want to ensure a good fallback for all of your users, a script like
      the one below which detects IE and then adjusts the x2 and y2 attributes
      on the element is required.


      ```

      // Test to see if navigator agent is IE

      // In that case, manually place the forward white spinner line.

      function msieversion(){
        var ua = window.navigator.userAgent;
        var msie = ua.indexOf('MSIE ');

        if (msie > 0 || !!navigator.userAgent.match(/Trident.*rv\:11\./)) { // If Internet Explorer
          var g = document.querySelectorAll('.lf-spinner-forward-line');
          for(let i = 0; i <= g.length; i++) {
            g[i].setAttribute('x2', '100%');
            g[i].setAttribute('y2', '-30%');
          }
        }
        return false;
      }

      ```
