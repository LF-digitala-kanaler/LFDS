      ## How to use


      When panels are in use, a page is usually divided into several cards (without images), each with their own heading, with full width across the component on top of our gray background. These can contain anything, frequent examples include test, tables and forms.


      ### Versions


      Panels have two main versions; always open and collapsible/expandable. There are no set rules for when to use collapsed or expanded, but a rule of thumb is to have cards with prioritised information expanded by default and the ones with secondary information collapsed. 


      ### Modifiers


      Our panels have several modifiers, but only one which exists for both always open and collapsible/expandable panels, namely "load more". The "load more" is to be used when you have a panel with lots of possible data (like a transaction list), and it isn't feasible or desirable to show all data at once.


      **Modifiers for collapsible panels**


      Collapsible have a few additional modifiers:


      * Collapsible cards can be either collapsed or expanded by default. 

      * If a card fetches information from a backend system there is a version of the panel which has a *lazy load* function which allows for the data to first be fetched if/when a user expands that specific panel. Great for slow backend systems!


      ## Please consider


      * You always need to involve our art directors, but when designing a page with many panels that sweet sweet AD love is extra needed.

      * Panels are often used as a frame for [tables](tables).
