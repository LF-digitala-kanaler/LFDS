      ## How to use


      When panels are in use, a page is usually divided into several cards
      (without images), each with their own heading, with full width across the
      component on top of our gray background. These can contain anything,
      frequent examples include test, tables and forms.


      Panels have several versions, with the two main ones being always open and
      collapsible/expandable. The collapsible in turn can be either collapsed or
      expanded by default. There are no set rules for when to use collapsed or
      expanded, but a rule of thumb is to use have the cards with the
      prioritised information expanded by default and the ones with secondary
      collapsed. 


      If a card fetches information from a backend system there is a version of
      the panel which has a lazy load function which allows for the data to
      first be fetched if/when a user expands that specific panel. Great for
      backend systems which are in need to be replaced.


      If you’re working with a page with lots of possible data (lika a
      transaction list) you’ll probably want to use the load more modifier.


      ## Please consider


      You always need to involve our art directors, but when designing a page
      with many panels that sweet sweet AD love is extra needed.
