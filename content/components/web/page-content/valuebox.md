title: Value Box
intro: >-
  The value box is intended to draw the users attention and for them to
  at-a-glance see the total value of the related content. It is primarily used
  in Mina sidor to display value of total/specific content.

      ## How to use


      The value box summarises what is shown in more detailed on the rest of the
      page, and should be placed high in the visual hierarchy. If you want to
      you may use several value boxes on one page, but then they should be
      visually grouped with each other (for a live example, look at a specific
      pension in Mina sidor).


      There are two versions of the value box, one where the header is
      expandable (if the content needs explanation - need to be short and
      snappy; if you can’t keep it short the value probably shouldn’t be
      summarised in a value box to start with) and one with only the label.


      ## Please consider


      As price box, value box and callout all are various ways of highlighting
      information you should avoid mixing them in one view.
