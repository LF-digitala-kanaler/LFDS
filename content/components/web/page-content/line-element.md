      ## How to use


      Use the line element to separate parts of the page from each other when needed.  It has the shape of an horizontal line and we use the standard html-tag HR (which is an abbreviation of horizontal rule) and just style it to fit in at Länsförsäkringar. It is typically placed in a block of text to help signify a change in content within the larger context.


      ### Modifier


      There are two versions of the line element, one to be used on a white background and one to be used on a grey background.


      ## Please note


      * If you need a clearer division between various parts of your text, consider using the more common [panel-component](panel).

      * The usage of the line element as a stylistic device on some headers on the landing page of [lansforsakringar.se](https://www.lansforsakringar.se/) should be seen as exception and shouldn't be reused elsewhere. If that effect is wanted, it should be done by styling the header in such fashion.
