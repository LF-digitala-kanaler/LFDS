      ## How to use


      The card comes in several versions all featuring a prominent picture at the top followed by a heading and short text. They all feature a date stamp, but its placement varies between designs (in some implementations the date stamp is replaced by a label such as “Erbjudande” or “Just nu”, but they aren’t part of LFUI).


      Cards are typically placed at the bottom of a page to give more options to users.


      ## Please consider


      Cards have historically been a part of page templates in both lansforsakringar.se and Mina sidor, but their future usage is under consideration as page templates are being redesigned so please check if the component still should be used before using it!
