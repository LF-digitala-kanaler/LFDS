      ## How to use


      Cards are used to promote something and consist of an image, a label, date stamp and some text. Cards are typically placed at the bottom of a page to displaying informational or promotional content to users.


      The card comes in several versions all featuring a prominent picture at the top followed by a heading and short text. They all feature a date stamp, but its placement varies between designs (in some implementations the date stamp is replaced by a label such as “Erbjudande” or “Just nu”, but they aren’t part of LFUI).


      ## Please consider


      Cards have historically been a part of page templates in both lansforsakringar.se and Mina sidor, but their future usage is under consideration as page templates are being redesigned so please check if the component still should be used before using it!
