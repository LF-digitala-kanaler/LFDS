      ## How to use


      Lead paragraphs are used to grab the user's attention so that they want to continue reading more. This is used by summarising the contents of the page and highlighting the most important USPs on product-oriented pages. Lead paragraphs should be short and snappy - try to keep them to two or three sentences.


      Lead paragraphs should be the first thing after the [display heading ](headings#display-headings-h1)when used. It is not mandatory, but encouraged to use lead paragraphs on pages. Stylewise lead paragraphs are in set in Intro Cond regular and a larger font size than the normal paragraph text.




      Payoff - Another name but kinda the same. Used as a payoff under headlines for further explanation. Usually one short sentences.
