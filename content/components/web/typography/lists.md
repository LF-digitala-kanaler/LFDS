      ## How to use


      List elements helps to break up large blocks of text, make complex articles and product information easier to grasp, and make key information stand out.


      We have a few different variations of lists


      * List with dots

      * List with numbers

      * Lists with checkmarks

      * Link lists


      A common question with lists are:


      Where to put a **link in a list?** Man kan länka i en punktlista. Vår huvudregel är ju att inte bryta av en text med länkar och att de ska placeras under ett stycke, men i detta fall kan användaren ha svårt att koppla ihop vilken länk som tillhör vilken punkt i listan, så därför är regeln här: om inte listan leder till EN action att bistå varje punkt med sin specifika länk. 


      Where to put the **external icon in a link list**? You can read more about that in the specifik link list part below.


      The Web is usually not the place for long, narrative writing. Instead, Web readers prefer copy formatted for ease of scanning, which allows them to easily skip through chunks of text to get to areas of interest. Read more here //länk till copy undersida


      ### List with dots


      Can also be called bulleted list. Bulleted lists attract attention, support scanning, shorten text, and reveal the relationship of items. 


      ### List with numbers


      Use numbered lists only when the sequence or count of items are important.


      Numbered lists are usually reserved for instances in which the items must occur in a specific order, such as steps in a procedure, or when keeping count is important, such as a top 10 list.


      #### Modifier


      **Big numbers**\

      In lf.se we have a modifier with big numbers and a cirkel around for a better visual popout effect. These lists we recommend to have 2-4 list items.


      ### List with checkmars


      We often use checkmark list when to highlight Unike selling points (USP) or when to compare different levels of products such as the care insurance different parts. 


      See exempel in the intro text and the table och the [car insurance product page](https://www.lansforsakringar.se/privat/forsakring/bilforsakring/).

      **Big Checkmarks**\

      In lf.se we have a modifier with big checkmarks and a cirkel around for a better visual popout effect. These lists we recommend to have 2-4 list items.


      ### Link lists

      ### List spacing[](https://lf-digitala-kanaler.github.io/LFUI/650/#/type#list-spacing)


      You can use two different types of spacing between lists. Vad är det för regler när de olika ska användas? //Lägg till


      Note that[ ](https://lf-digitala-kanaler.github.io/LFUI/650/#/links/)link lists also have special rules on their spacing when placed vertically.


      ### To break down long sentences


      You should always strive for having short items in the lists but sometimes it is harder to do. Here are some help. 


      **Do sections instead**\

      Use a headline instead and break it out to different sections of text, it makes the readers identify the main points of each section and easier to grasp. To highlight and simulate dots you can always make a small graphical element to the right of the textarea.


      **Headings in list items**\

      You should always have short items in the list but sometimes it is harder to do. Make a headline short and pop out with bold text then make a new row in the dot item and put the longer sentence under. 


      ## Please consider


      * Try to have maximum one list a page

      * Only have 3-5 points in the list

      * Have similar line lengths

      * Use the same feel/spirit for list items

      * Don’t require end punctuation

      Lists in LFUI have the appearance listed below. Also provided (in addition
      to Bootstrap's list utility classes) are utility classes to alter the list
      appearance further.


      The default styling of `ol`  and `ul` is achieved by adding the corresponding class to the element at hand. This means if you're building an ul, also append the `ul` class to that element (and vice versa in the `ol` case).
