      ## How to use


      In LFUI we have opted to use donut charts rather than pie charts - the difference between the two are solely aesthetic. Donut charts show the proportional size of different values (like [distribution bars](distribution-bar)) and work best if you have three to six values.


      Donut charts work best for values around 25%, 50% or 75%. It’s easier for readers to spot these percentages in a pie chart than in a stacked bar or column chart.


      ### Modifiers


      There are a few options available to modify the standard donut chart:


      * You can choose between several [colour options](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#color) for your chart

      * There are two sizes: small (105\*105) and medium (210\*210)

      * If you wish to, you can add text in the "hole" of the donut


      ### Legends and colours


      All the graphs have the same legends and colour styles, read more [here](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find [here](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#type-of-graph).


      ## Please consider


      * Donut charts are not the best choice if you want readers to compare the size of shares with similar sizes
