      ## How to use


      The map chart displays a flat (europe-centric) world map. All land mass is grey by default, and as the map is populated the countries/regions with data associated to them are coloured using the [LFUI map colours](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#colour).


      As the map can be populated either on a country-by-country-basis or divided into regions, it is important to make sure that the legend corresponds to what is shown on the map.


      ### Legends and colours

      All the graphs have the same legends and colour styles, read more [here](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find [here](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#type-of-graph).
