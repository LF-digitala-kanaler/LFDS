      ## How to use


      Graphs are used to visualize data and to help people quickly understand
      and use information that are too numerous or complicated to be described
      adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however, use graphs for
      small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.

      _In LFUI version 5.3.0 these colors are not 100% WCAG AA-approved, and are
      most likely bound to change._


      LFUI provides a few scales to choose from that will color your visual data
      according to the visual profile of Länsförsäkringar. The visual identity
      set a prefereble scale of blue or red. Below we have set different set to
      make it the same for all graphs.
