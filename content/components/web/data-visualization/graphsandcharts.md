      ## How to use


      Graphs are used to visualize data and to help people quickly understand
      and use information that are too numerous or complicated to be described
      adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however, use graphs for
      small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.

      set a prefereble scale of blue or red. Below we have set diffrens set to
      make it the same for att graphs.
