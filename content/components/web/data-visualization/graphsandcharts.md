      ## How to use


      Graphs are used to visualize data and to help people quickly understand
      and use information that are too numerous or complicated to be described
      adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however, use graphs for
      small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.


      Drawing and presenting data visually in graphs, charts, diagrams or even
      maps are powerful tools which help the user understand and comprehend the
      data more intuitively. When dealing with shares, funds, money and other
      more or less "complicated" bank matters, visualizing the data is often
      recommended.


      ### Setting color scales


      _In LFUI version 5.3.0 these colors are not 100% WCAG AA-approved, and are
      most likely bound to change._


      LFUI provides a few scales to choose from that will color your visual data
      according to the visual profile of Länsförsäkringar. The visual identity
      set a prefereble scale of blue or red. Below we have set different set to
      make it the same for all graphs.


      #### Color sets


      Here are the latest sets of colors to use. We are going to update the
      colors to set colors furder apart from

      * Hybrid - 4 colors

      * Map - 15 colors

      * Disabled / not selected / inactive color is grey #d9d9d9 (smoke).




      #### Accessibility




      #### Legends


      Important to each graphical element is a legend describing the visual
      data. The legends should be 16x16 pixels, with text in Arial that
      describes the legend.


      Position-wise, they should be in close relation to the graph itself.
      Prefereble on the right or under the graph.




      #### Interactivity


      If the graph/chart has interactivity attached to it. Click on the legends
      to highlight the different parts in the graph. Even the text of the legend
      should be clickable.
