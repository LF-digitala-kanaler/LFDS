      ## How to use


      Graphs are used to visualize data and to help people quickly understand
      and use information that are too numerous or complicated to be described
      adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however, use graphs for
      small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.




      ### LFUI color scales


      In LFUI version 5.3.0 these colors are not 100% WCAG AA-approved, and are
      most likely bound to change.




      D3 allows the use of color scales which can be iterated through and bound
      to data. LFUI provides a few scales to choose from that will color your
      visual data according to the visual profile of LF.




      The color scales are Ordinal Scales, and iterated through like other data.
      Copy the arrays below assign them to your colorScale variable. In the
      examples below you can see it in use.
