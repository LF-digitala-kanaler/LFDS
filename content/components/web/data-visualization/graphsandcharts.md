      ## How to use


      Graphs are used to visualize data and to help people quickly understand
      and use information that are too numerous or complicated to be described
      adequately in the text and in less space. Do not, however, use graphs for
      small amounts of data that could be conveyed succinctly in a sentence.


      Drawing and presenting data visually in graphs, charts, diagrams or even
      maps are powerful tools which help the user understand and comprehend the
      data more intuitively. When dealing with shares, funds, money and other
      more or less "complicated" bank matters, visualizing the data is often
      recommended.


      ### Type of graph


      There are different kind of graphs to use, here comes some way of thinking
      wen to use them:


      #### . . . a Line graph


      Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time.
      When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs.
      Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of
      time for more than one group.


      #### . . . a Pie Chart.


      Pie charts are best to use when you are trying to compare parts of a
      whole. They do not show changes over time.


      <figure class="Image Image__border"><img src="/img/exempel-graph-pie.png"
      srcset="/img/exempel-graph-pie.png 2x" alt="/img/exempel-graph-pie.png
      2x""><figcaption><div class="Image__caption"></div></figcaption></figure>


      #### . . . a Bar Graph.


      Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track
      changes over time. However, when trying to measure change over time, bar
      graphs are best when the changes are larger.


      <figure class="Image Image__background"><img
      src="/img/exempel-graph-bar.png" srcset="/img/exempel-graph-bar.png 2x"
      alt="/img/exempel-graph-bar.png 2x""><figcaption><div
      class="Image__caption"></div></figcaption></figure>


      #### . . . an Area Graph.


      Area graphs are very similar to line graphs. They can be used to track
      changes over time for one or more groups. Area graphs are good to use when
      you are tracking the changes in two or more related groups that make up
      one whole category (for example public and private groups).


      <figure class="Image Image__border"><img
      src="/img/exempel-graph-linje.png" srcset="/img/exempel-graph-linje.png
      2x" alt=""><figcaption><div
      class="Image__caption"></div></figcaption></figure>


      #### . . . an X-Y Plot.


      X-Y plots are used to determine relationships between the two different
      things. The x-axis is used to measure one event (or variable) and the
      y-axis is used to measure the other. If both variables increase at the
      same time, they have a positive relationship. If one variable decreases
      while the other increases, they have a negative relationship. Sometimes
      the variables don't follow any pattern and have no relationship.


      #### . . . a Map Chart.


      Use a map if you have data with a geographical component. Maps can shade
      areas in proportion to mapped values, allowing for visual pop-out of
      high-value areas. Data for map charts must contain geographical names
      corresponding to the geographical entities represented on the map. 


      <figure class="Image Image__background"><img
      src="/img/exempel-graph-cart.png" srcset="/img/exempel-graph-cart.png 2x"
      alt="/img/exempel-graph-cart.png 2x""><figcaption><div
      class="Image__caption"></div></figcaption></figure>


      ### The different parts


      #### Legends


      Important to each graphical element is a legend describing the visual
      data. The legends should be 16x16 pixels, with text in Arial that
      describes the legend.


      Position-wise, they should be in close relation to the graph itself.
      Prefereble on the right or under the graph.


      #### Interactivity


      If the graph/chart has interactivity attached to it. Click on the legends
      to highlight the different parts in the graph. Even the text of the legend
      should be clickable.


      #### Color


      LFUI provides a few scales to choose from that will color your visual data
      according to the visual profile of Länsförsäkringar. The visual identity
      set a prefereble scale of blue or red. Below we have set different set to
      make it the same for all graphs.


      We are going to update the colors for better accessibility. \[2019-12-01]


      Here are the latest sets of colors to use:


      * Blue colors - 10 colors

      * Red colors - 10 colors

      * Blue to red - 16 colors

      * Red to blue - 16 colors

      * Hybrid - 4 colors

      * Map - 15 colors

      * Disabled / not selected / inactive color is grey #d9d9d9 (smoke).


      #### Accessibility


      Charts, graphs and maps use visuals to convey complex images to users. But
      since they are images, these media provide serious accessibility issues to
      colorblind users and users of screen readers. 


      Generally speaking an ALT tag cannot do justice to a complex chart. One
      way to describe a chart is to provide both a text summary and a properly
      coded data table near the chart.


      This serves multiple audiences because a chart can show trends, but a
      table can provide exact data for those who are interested.
