      ## How to use


      Line charts are used to display changes over a period of time. As they are the go to charts for showing how value of a fund or stock has changed over time they are the most commonly used charts at Länsförsäkringar.


      Line charts can be shown with either just one line (*how has this fund's value changed over time?*) or several *(compare different funds over time*). The visual layout is somewhat different depending on whether you use one line or several:


      * If there is only one line we add a shading from the bottom of the chart to the top of the line.

      * If there are multiple lines, there is no shading as this decreases readability.


      ### Legends and colors


      All the graphs have the same legends and color styles, read more [here](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find [here](patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#type-of-graph).


      ## Please consider


      * Line charts usually have a large number of data points, if you only have a few - consider using a [bar chart](bar-chart) instead.
