  Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time.
  When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs.
  Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time

      ## How to use


      Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time.
      When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs.
      Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of
      time for more than one group.


      All the graphs have the same modifiers and legends styles, that we talk
      about
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find
