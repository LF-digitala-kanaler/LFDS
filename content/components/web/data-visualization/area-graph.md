  changes over time for one or more groups. "

      ## How to use


      Use area charts only if you want to show how values develop over time. 


      If you want to show how values differ in different categories, consider a (stacked) bar, column chart or split bars instead. 


      **Best to use**


      * how values develop over time

      * if the total is as important as its shares

      * when large differences between your values


      ### Legends and colors


      All the graphs have the same legends and color styles, read more [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#type-of-graph).




      ## Please consider


      If you want to show how values differ in different categories, consider a (stacked) bar, column chart or split bars instead.
