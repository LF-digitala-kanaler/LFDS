description: >-
  Area graphs are very similar to line graphs. They can be used to track changes
  over time for one or more groups. Area graphs are good to use when you are
  tracking the changes in two or more related groups that make up one whole
  category.

      ## How to use


      Use area charts only if you want to show how values develop over time. 


      If you want to show how values differ in different categories, consider a
      (stacked) bar, column chart or split bars instead. 


      **Best to use**


      * how values develop over time

      * if the total is as important as its shares

      * when large differences between your values


      ### Legends and colors


      All the graphs have the same legends and color styles, read more
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#type-of-graph).
