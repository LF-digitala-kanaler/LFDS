      ## How to use


      Pie charts are generally used to show percentage or proportional data and
      usually the percentage represented by each category is provided next to
      the pie in legends. Pie charts are good for displaying data for around 6
      categories or fewer.


      Pie charts work best for values around 25%, 50% or 75%. Itâ€™s easier for
      readers to spot these percentages in a pie chart than in a stacked bar or
      column chart.


      **Work best**


      * for values around 25%, 50% or 75%

      * if you only have a few values - three to six


      ### Legends and colors


      All the graphs have the same legends and color styles, read more
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#type-of-graph).


      <figure class="Image Image__border"><img src="/img/exempel-graph-pie.jpg"
      srcset="/img/exempel-graph-pie.jpg 2x" alt="/img/exempel-graph-pie.jpg
      2x""><figcaption><div class="Image__caption">/img/exempel-graph-pie.jpg
      2x"</div></figcaption></figure>


      ## Please consider


      * grouping slices together in one bigger slice

      * Pie charts are not the best choice if you want readers to compare the
      size of shares with similar sizes
