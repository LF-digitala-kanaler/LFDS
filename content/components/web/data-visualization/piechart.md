      ## How to use


      Pie charts are generally used to show percentage or proportional data and
      usually the percentage represented by each category is provided next to
      the pie in legends. Pie charts are good for displaying data for around 6
      categories or fewer.


      All the graphs have the same modifiers and legends styles, that we talk
      about
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find
      [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#type-of-graph).
