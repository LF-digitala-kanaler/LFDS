      ## How to use


      Line graphs are used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs. Line graphs can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.


      ### Legends and colors


      All the graphs have the same legends and color styles, read more [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#the-different-parts).


      When to use different graphs you find [here](https://lfui-beta-aedd0a.netlify.com/components/web/data-visualization/graphsand-charts#type-of-graph).
