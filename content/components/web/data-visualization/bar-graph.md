description: Bar charts presents data in proportion to the values they
  represent. You can compare either various data sources for the same time
  period or the same data source over several different time spans. A typical
  use case at Länsförsäkringar is to compare the development of a fund or stock
  between various years.

      ## How to use


      Use a bar chart when you want to compare various data sources for the same time period or the same data source over several different time spans. When using a bar chart you need to consider the following in your scaling:


      * A bar chart should always have a clear 0-point.

      * The scaling should be done so that all data fits within the chart.

      * The values should be proportional.

        * This leads to bar charts not being recommended if you expect the difference between the various bars to be small, as it will be hard for the user to read the chart and gain any meaningful insights from it.

      ### Legends and colors


      All the graphs have the same legends and color styles, read more [here](/patterns/general-patterns/graphs-and-when-to-use-them#the-different-parts).
