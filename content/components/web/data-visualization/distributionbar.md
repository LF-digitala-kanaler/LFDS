      ## How to use


      The distribution bar is great for illustrating how different values relate
      to one another. 


      You can have the text of procent in the bar or in top of the bar. A
      recommendation is to not show the percentage value inside the bar unless
      the width is at least 5% or above (depending on your parent width, of
      course) to make sure the value fits.




      ### Colors


      Colors are automatically set in a repeating sequence of navy, blue, sky
      and baby. You can also use the colors set for graphs that we have made for
      16 different levels.




      ### Pointer separator


      Further customisation can be made by adding the
      distribution-value-with-pointer-class to a distribution-value to have the
      separator in the shape of an arrow. This can be used for values that are
      growing, or are expected to grow.


      NOTE: A styling recommendation is to not show the arrow at small values,
      as the arrow has a width around 10px and might disrupt the accuracy of the
      bar.


      Also do note that perfect styling for the arrow is not possible for the
      third (or distribution-sky) distribution-value, as the striped pattern can
      not be applied to the border. Should you need the arrow on your third
      value, overwrite it with a manual color (see above section).
