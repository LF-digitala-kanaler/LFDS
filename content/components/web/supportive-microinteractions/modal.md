      ## How to use


      Modals are used mainly in document flows where the user needs additional
      information, but you don't want to break or exit the flow to mediate this
      information. Typical examples include "Läs mer"-buttons containing more
      details on a specific function/choice that is seen as relevant, but
      secondary, to the user in order to make this choice.


      Modals can also work in a more functional-oriented way: To sign and apply
      a flow with the help of BankID uses a Modal (instead of taking up a
      separate page in a form, hence not worrying the user that the information
      they have applied so far isn't lost); the "Tyck till" dialogue box which
      wants to prompt the user to send in information without the perceived
      hassle of having to leave the current page the user is standing on; etc.


      A modal is not intended to take up the full width and height of a page,
      even less so forcing the user to scroll to read its entirety. In that
      case, a separate page might be a better choice. 


      ## Please consider


      Modals are great in a desktop or tablet-context but can easily become
      troublesome in a mobile context. As mobile usage has increased, the use of
      modals in our designs for “[read more](../)” has decreased. Take expected
      mobile usage into consideration when choosing whether to use a modal or
      another solution for “read more”.
