  The callout is used to highlight information which we want the user to notice
  in relation to a chunk of text.

      ## How to use


      Use the callout to highlight crucial information so it doesn’t disappear
      in a chunk of text. A good example is telephone numbers to injury claims
      on product pages. Typical headings for a callout are “Viktig information”,
      “Tips för …” and “Tänk på …”.


      The small red corner appears with an animation as the callout comes into
      view for the user to help bring attention to the callout.


      ## Please consider


      As price box, value box and callout all are various ways of highlighting
      information you should avoid mixing them in one view.
