      ## How to use


      The card comes in several versions all featuring a prominent picture at
      the top followed by a heading and short text. They all feature a date
      stamp, but its placement varies between designs (in some implementations
      the date stamp is replaced by a label such as “Erbjudande” or “Just nu”,
      but they aren’t part of LFUI).


      Cards are typically placed at the bottom of a page to give more options to
      users.


      ## Please consider


      Cards have historically been a part of page templates in both
      lansforsakringar.se and Mina sidor, but their future usage is under
      consideration as page templates are being redesigned so please check if
      the component still should be used before using it!
