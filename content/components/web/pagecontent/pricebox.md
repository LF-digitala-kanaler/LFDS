title: Price Box
intro: >-
  The Price-box component displays the price/cost in a sidebar (desktop)/at the
  bottom of the screen (mobile) in flows where the user can purchase/sign-up for
  something. The price is updated as the user makes various choices in the main
  flow.

      ## How to use?


      The pricebox changes placement between desktop and mobile views.


      In **desktop** it is shown at the top of the right column, and sticks to
      the top of the screen as the user scrolls down (except in Mina sidor). The
      price is shown prominently (either one-time price or monthly/yearly
      depending on the service/business requirements). A wave pattern separates
      the overall price from a breakdown of what influences the price; examples
      of such includes selected add-ons and discounts. Optionally a grey
      information box can be added at the bottom to inform the user of
      possibilities for more discounts if they have more products with us.


      In **mobile/tablet** the price box is displayed at the bottom of the
      screen (as there is no column to the right). In itâ€™s default view the
      price box is compressed and only the price is shown. If the user clicks on
      the price box it expands and the more detailed price information is shown
      below a wavy pattern (the same information as in desktop).


      If there is a discount (there usually is) there is a sub-component to
      highlight the discount. It is based on our alerts, but spans several lines
      and includes an animated checkbox.


      ## Please consider


      The price box is only to be used in flows where the user/customer is
      signing up for/purchasing a service.


      In desktop: The price box should always be visible for the user, and thus
      is sticky to the top when the user starts scrolling. This means that you
      need to try to keep the right column short to avoid that the price box is
      pushed out of the screen when the right column hits the bottom.


      Accesibility-wise it is important that pricebox is before the primary
      button in the main flow so that people who use screen readers get access
      to the information.  


      As price box, value box and callout all are various ways of highlighting
      information you should avoid mixing them in one view.
