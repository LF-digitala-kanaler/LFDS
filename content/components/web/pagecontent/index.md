intro: >
  The page content section contains components which are used in-page to display
  information in comparison to normal body text. As price box, value box and
  callout all are various ways of highlighting information you should avoid
  mixing them in one view.

  Note that several of the components in this section actually are set ways of
  combining other components, and perhaps wouldnâ€™t be considered components if
  created today. For legacy reasons they are kept as components though.
