      ## How to use


      Use the spinner when you expect that the user will have to wait for all
      data to be loaded or the server to respond. The spinner is the option to
      be used when this situation happens in the main page content. Please look
      at button with spinner ([primary](../button-and-links/buttons) /
      [secondary](../button-and-links/secondary-button)) if you want a loading
      state upon the user submitting data or [panel with lazy
      load](../page-content/panel) if the data being loaded is in a panel. 


      ### Versions


      The main version of the spinner consists of a circle alternating between
      our blue and red colours on a white background. You should strive towards
      using this version of the spinner, but be aware that it requires a white
      background to look good (for code reasons).
