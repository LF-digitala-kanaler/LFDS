      ## How to use


      Use the spinner when you expect that the user will have to wait for all
      data to be loaded or the server to respond. The spinner is the option to
      be used when this situation happens in the main page content. Please look
      at button with spinner ([primary](../..//button-and-links/buttons) /
      [secondary](../../button-and-links/secondary-button)) if you want a
      loading state upon the user submitting data or [panel with lazy
      load](../../page-content/panel) if the data being loaded is in a panel.
