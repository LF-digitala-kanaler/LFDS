## Disabled buttons

- Marked as a deprecated pattern in 4.2.0

Länsförsäkringar does no longer encourages the use of disabled buttons.

Instead, keep buttons clickable and display a message on why it does not function when it's clicked, along with what the user should do to make it function. If a button is never intended to be functional, do not include it, to begin with.

<Lfuiwrapper>
<button class="btn btn-primary disabled">Don't click me</button>
<button class="btn btn-outline-secondary disabled">Don't click me</button>
</Lfuiwrapper>

## Modal-air

- Marked as deprecated in 5.1.0

The `.modal-air` appearance was made the default look for modals.

## Automatic form validation

- Marked as deprecated in 5.1.0

Automatic validation, specified below, is no longer included. You now have to apply the correct classes yourself with JavaScript.

All form elements have their valid state applied when it has a valid value. The styles do not apply whilst the element has focus. The native `:valid` selector is used to achieve this, so ensure to implement proper type and pattern attributes. To disable validation, add the `novalidate` property to the enclosing form element.

If you implement custom validation, we recommend that you set the `formnovalidate` property on the submit button, to enjoy the benefits of visual validation without the actual native validation logic being triggered.
