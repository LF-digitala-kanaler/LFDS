intro: >-
  The timeline component is an interactive way for the user to follow the
  progress of an (ongoing) errand, such as a damage claim or loan application.

      The timeline typically displays an errand from start to finish (although a
      reversed timeline for "latest activity in your account" can easily be
      imagined). Each activity in the timeline can be expanded to read more
      about what has/will happened/happen in that step.


      On entering the detail view, the current step is expanded (backend should
      provide which step which is current, and of course there can only be one
      active state). The rest are collapsed. To expand a card you can click
      anywhere on the card. To collapse a card you can click on the part above
      the divider line (or also on Stäng in mobile view). Interacting with one
      card won’t affect any of the surrounding card statewise. E.g. You could
      open all cards if you wish.
