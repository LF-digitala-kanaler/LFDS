  The navbar is the foundation for the various menus used at Länsförsäkringar.
  As each channel/system has its own need from a menu it is however always
  modified for that environment.

      ## How to use


      The navbar differs from our other components in that it is a foundation to
      build on, rather than a set design. If you're designing on a system level
      and need a new menu, use the navbar as your starting point and then adapt
      it to what suits your environment.


      ### Versions


      We have two versions of our navbar; blue and white. Technically you could
      use any colour combination you want, but using other colours than blue and
      white should only be done as a last resort.


      #### Blue navbar


      The blue navbar should only be used for customer-facing
      systems/applications, and when in use it should be the main menu.


      #### White navbar


      The white navbar is used as a secondary menu (like the "personal menu" on
      Mina Sidor) or in internal systems.
