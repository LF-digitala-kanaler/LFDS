      ## How to use


      Tabs should be used for navigation inside a page. This means that tabs are
      the most local way of navigating, and should only be used for when it
      doesn't make sense to divide the content into several items in the main
      navigation. Tabs are primarily used in "closed environments" such as Mina
      Sidor and internal systems. Good examples of tab use include
      settings-pages and navigation within one instance of a product of which a
      customer may have many (such as occupational pension).


      Changing a tab should affect everything below it within the container/page
      and nothing above it.


      ### Versions


      We have two main versions of tabs;


      * **Page-level navigation** are tabs which control the whole page

      * **In-page navigation** are tabs which only control the container they
      are in
