      ## How to use


      Our pagination is one of the components which have gone through the most
      design iterations and discussions. Please refer to [Design
      rationale](#design-rationale) below for why this particular design has
      triumphed over alternatives.


      Layoutwise the pagination is really simple: the number of pages available
      is listed with a visible number for each page. The styling of the
      numbering depends on where in the flow the user is:


      * **Previous pages** have a white background with a blue text. By default
      the page number is clickable and lets the user return to that specific
      page. On hover the number is underlined.

      * The **current page** has a blue background with a white text.

      * **Upcoming pages** have a white background and grey text.
