      ## How to use


      Our pagination is one of the components which have gone through the most
      design iterations and discussions. Please refer to [Design
      rationale](#design-rationale) below for why this particular design has
      triumphed over alternatives.


      Layoutwise the pagination is really simple: the number of pages available
      is listed with a visible number for each page. The styling of the
      numbering depends on where in the flow the user is:


      * **Previous pages** have a white background with a blue text. By default
      the page number is clickable and lets the user return to that specific
      page. On hover the number is underlined.

      * The **current page** has a blue background with a white text.

      * **Upcoming pages** have a white background and grey text.


      In responsive mode for small screens the pagination is full row width.


      When we determine number of pages included in the numbering we count the
      number of pages from the start of the service, including the receipt if
      such exists. We do however not include any intermediary pages in which the
      user submits initial data needed for the service (this as there are often
      many ways to enter such a service, and the most common way is usually as
      part of a product page on lansforsakringar.se).


      Although we number the receipt page we do not show the pagination on the
      receipt page. This is as a pagination here wouldn't provide any value to
      the user, as they've finished the flow and wouldn't be able to go
      backwards in the flow as the data has been submitted.


      ### Modifier


      One modifier exists for pagination; the possibility to be able to navigate
      to a previous page can be turned off if it could cause more problems than
      benefits for the user to navigate back. For example, it is used in such a
      way in flows where the user has to identify/sign with BankID in the middle
      of a flow (which in turn should be avoided if possible, but that isn't
      always possible for architectural or security reasons).


      ## Design rationale


      Over the years a number of alternative design, all more descriptive have
      been tested in both qualitative and quantitive tests. To the surprise of
      many the scaled down version in use has outperformed the more descriptive
      versions in all tests. Below are two examples of alternative versions
      which have been tested, and failed.


      **a/b-tested version**\

      The version below was used in an a/b-test during autumn 2019 and resulted
      in a lower conversion rate than the pagination in use.

      class="Image__caption"></div></figcaption></figure>


      **Qualitative**\

      When the current version of pagination was designed there was a lot of
      discussion in the design team as whether to use it or a more explanatory
      version. A number of sketches of different alternatives were tested, and
      the current design was chosen as the winner after a number of discussions
      and user tests.
