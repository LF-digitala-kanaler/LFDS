      ## How to use


      Breadcrumbs are a part of the page templates on lansforsakringar.se and
      Mina sidor and are generated automatically, so there isn't much to think
      about regarding breadcrumbs for you as a designer of customer facing web
      applications.


      If you are designing an internal system you should consider whether
      breadcrumbs are of benefit for your users. In a smaller, flat system you
      might not see the need, but the larger the system, the bigger the need
      probably is (especially as the navigation structure gets deeper and
      deeper).
