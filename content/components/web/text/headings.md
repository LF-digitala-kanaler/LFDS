      ## How to use


      Use headings as you would anywhere else - to divide texts into sections and explain what the user can expect of the text under the heading. Headings helps the users to quickly find what they're interested in.


      Responsiveness is handled differently in different channels, but a rule of thumb is to work with the smaller headings.


      ### Variations


      There are two variations of headings at Länsförsäkringar:


      * Standard h1-h6 headings in typeface Intro Cond.

      * Display headings (hero headings) in typeface LF Rubrik.


      ### Standard headings (h1-h6)


      All normal headlines are set in Intro Cond Bold. The headings have margin spacing rules depending on their position in a section. 


      **H1-H5** have the text-colour "[Navy](/visual-identity/colors#complimentary-colors)" and only vary in size.\

      **H6** is quite different however, the text is capitalized and the text-colour is "[Grey](/visual-identity/colors#black-white-and-some-shades-of-grey)".


      We generally discourage from making headings into links as many users miss those links, but it is a rule with exceptions. For example our [card-component ](../page-content/card)features clickable headings. When headings h1-h5 are made clickable their colour change to standard link colour "[Länsförsäkringar blue](/visual-identity/colors#primary-colors)" and an underline is added on hover. An example of this can be seen below.

      #### Display headings (h1)


      Display headings are written in LF Rubrik and should only be used as the main headline of a page. Technically they are css-class added to the h1, meaning that the next level of heading should be h2.


      Display heading use the ["Länsförsäkringar blue" colour](/visual-identity/colors#primary-colors) (#00427a).


      ##### Specific modifiers


      Two types of modifiers exist for display headings; size and colour.


      ###### Size


      You have four sizes of display-headings to choose from. Use common sense and a fine-tuned design eye to choose which one.


      When working with smaller screens it is recommended to only use display-3 or display-4.


      ###### Red words in headings


      If you want to emphasize some part of the heading you can choose to make that part "[Länsförsäkringar red](/visual-identity/colors#primary-colors)". The interplay between a blue heading with an emphasis on certain words with red colour is prominent in our ads and analog communication, and thus should be used in brand-bearing digital communication as well. As the red colour can disrupt the flow for certain users (like those with ADHD) we use it with caution in a digital context. 


      If you see fit to highlight certain words in red, you should consider the following:


      * Highlight the most important word(s)

      * If you highlight several words, they should be next to each other

      * Do not highlight more than three words

      * Make sure that most of the headline is in blue
