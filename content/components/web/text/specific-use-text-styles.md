      ## How to use


      This chapter describes text styles with specific use cases, such as in forms and tables. Below is which you can see the different types of text styles used in forms and the relation to each other and other form elements.


      <figure class="Image Image__border "><img src="/img/specific-use-text-styles.png" srcset="/img/specific-use-text-styles.png 2x" alt="Image exemplifying different text styles used in forms and how they relate to each other"><figcaption><div class="Image__caption">Different text styles used in forms and how they relate to each other</div></figcaption></figure>


      ### Labels


      Labels can be used in [tables](./page-content/tables) as well as [forms](./forms). In tables they are used as a headings for columns, and in forms they help help the user know what to enter in the adjacent form element (please see [form element grouping ](/patterns/form-patterns/form-element-grouping)for a thorough explanation). Labels should not be used for anything except this.


      Labels are written in Intro Cond bold, 16px and colour #222222.


      <div class="Callout"><strong class="Callout__title">Sentence-long questions </strong><p class="Callout__text">In some forms (like KYC and "HÃ¤lsodeklaration") we need to ask questions in sentence form rather than short and snappy labels. In those cases the boldness of the labels might reduce readability over time, so we recommend using Arial 16 px normal weight in those cases instead.</p></div>


      ### Input description/helptext


      At times you might want to give some context to the expected input or provide information on GDPR-compliance of the data provided by the user. Then input description/helptext/meta (same thing, many names) is your friend - read more about how to use it in [form element grouping](/patterns/form-patterns/form-element-grouping).


      The styling of input description is Arial 14px with colour #6B7070.


      ### Placeholder text


      Placeholder text is the optional text in the input area to help the user see the expected format. Again, the detailed description can be found on the [form element grouping](/patterns/form-patterns/form-element-grouping)-page.


      Placeholder text is rendered in Arial, 16 px and #8B8B8B.


      ### Error message


      Error messages are displayed in Intro Cond, bold weight, 14 px and #E30613.
