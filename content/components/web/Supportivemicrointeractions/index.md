title: Supportive Microinteractions
intro: >-
  The supportive microinteraction section includes components which the user can
  interact with in one way or the other in support of the main flow. The main
  type of supportive microinteractions are various ways of providing the user
  with more information, a.k.a “Read more”.

  ## Read more


  There are four accepted ways of providing information for the user with a
  “Read more”-function. Please note that there are no i-bubbles in LFUI. The
  four ways of providing “Read more”-information are:


  **Pop-over tooltip**: Used primarily as an explanation of terms and difficult
  words. When the user clicks/hovers a word with a pop-over tooltip a small
  modal appears in which explanatory text is displayed.


  **Collapse:** Lets the user expand the current page and displays examples or a
  longer explanation which support the user in performing their task. This is
  the most common way of showing Read more in relation to forms.


  **Modal:** Modals are triggered by the user clicking a button. They are used
  in a “Read more”-context when we provide more background information when we
  want to help the user make an informed decision.


  **Separate page** (not a component): If the read more-section is editorial
  material it should be put on a separate page, preferably on
  lansforsakringar.se (but use your judgement if somewhere else is more
  appropriate in your specific case).
