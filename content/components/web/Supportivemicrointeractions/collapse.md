      ## How to use


      The collapse-components standard placement is below a text block or input
      field, and contains a more detailed/thorough explanation of what was said
      before (text block) or help in what to enter (form).


      There are two visual variants of the component; one which expands with
      white background and one which expands with a grey background. Your
      context decides which one to use.


      Keep in mind how a collapsible panel affects page layout: it pushes
      everything below it downward. This might lead to awkward "flow" on a page,
      especially forms.


      ## Please consider


      It is important not to over-use this functionality. Information not
      crucial to the view should be weighted if it is relevant to print out at
      all. If information is considered crucial, it should not be hidden and
      require an action (collapse) to begin with. But take into consideration
      which channel you’re in as well:


      If you are on lansforsakringar.se without having logged in, a new page
      with editorial text is often a good option if you can’t keep it short and
      snappy. 


      If you’re logged in or in the process of buying something you want to keep
      the user in the main flow which leads to longer texts in collapsible mode
      being acceptable (but still not preferred). Please consider modals as an
      alternative if the text can’t be kept short.
