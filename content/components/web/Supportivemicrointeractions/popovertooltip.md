      ## How to use


      If a word (or series of words) has a tooltip on it, it has a grey dotted
      underline to show the user that it can be interacted with. The underline
      is designed to not be confused with a normal link.


      If a user hovers the word the tooltip is displayed until the cursor is
      moved away from the selected area. The user can also click the word which
      triggers a popover which stays open until the user clicks somewhere else.
      That is, the user can move the mouse pointer or scroll without the popover
      disappearing.


      No matter how the popover is triggered it allows for the user to move the
      cursor over it and interact with the popover without the popover closing.
      This means that links to even further information can be placed in the
      popover or that they user can copy text if the wish to do so.


      ## Please consider


      **Never use the popover-tooltip on a label!** A popover-tooltip is used on
      inline text to describe words in the flow of a document without breaking
      said flow. If you wish to describe words used in label you could either


      * Put the word in the input field description and use the popover-tooltip
      on it there

      * Use a separate "[LÃ¤s mer](collapse/)" button in proximity to the input
      field and move the information there.
