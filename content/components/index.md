  ## How components are displayed


  The different components are grouped together based on what they are used for, and you can  will find a visual example of each component on the group page to help you find the right component if you're unfamiliar with LFUI.


  ### The anatomy of a component page


  Each component page is built in the same way, with the following structure:


  * Lead paragraph which quickly explains when to use the component

  * Working examples of the different versions of the components, with each "variation" in a tab of its' own

  * Detailed information on how to use the component divided into two or three tabs

    * Design: how to use the component.
    * Code: how to implement the component.
    * Copy (where applicable): how to write copy for the component. *Note: as all of our copy is in Swedish, this contents of this tab is also described in Swedish.*

  In the **design** tab you will find that every component starts with a "How to use"-section. It is started with general guidelines, and then the different variations the component has and which modifiers it has is described. **Variations** are distinctly different ways of using a component (e.g. buttons are divided into [three variations](/components/web/button-and-links/buttons#variations) on the web: primary, secondary and log in). **Modifiers** are ways of styling the variations in different ways. These stylings can be either specific to a variation or general for all variations (for example, primary buttons on the web have both [specific modifiers](/components/web/button-and-links/buttons#modifier-for-primary-buttons) and [general modifiers](/components/web/button-and-links/buttons#modifiers) which they share with all buttons). Towards the end of the design tab you might find a "Please consider"-section with important tips for using the component, and a the very bottom "Other material" features guides on how to find the component in our current primary design tool and occasionally additional links related to the component.

LFUI can be described as the lego blocks which form the foundation of all digital interfaces we create at Länsförsäkringar. It is designed based on our [visual identity](/visual-identity), and standardised ways of using different components together can be found in the [patterns-section](/patterns).

If you want a further introduction to our components and how they are displayed, you can find it [at the bottom of this page](#how-components-are-displayed).
