  ## Components presentation


  The different components are categorised based on the use case, with visual examples for each component on the category pages so that you easily can find the component you need.


  ### The anatomy of a component page


  Each component is presented on a page that all have the same structure:


  * Leading introduction paragraph

  * Working examples of the components, including all different versions and options

  * Detailed guides on how to use the component

    * Design: how and when to use is
    * Code: how to implement
    * Copy (where applicable): how to write copy for it.

  The **design tab** includes general guidelines along with introductions to the different variations and modifiers.

  * **Variations** are distinctly different ways of using a component (e.g. buttons are divided into [three variations](/components/web/button-and-links/buttons#variations) on the web: primary, secondary and log in).

  * **Modifiers** are ways of styling the variations in different ways. These stylings can be either specific to a variation or general for all variations (for example, primary buttons on the web have both [specific modifiers](/components/web/button-and-links/buttons#modifier-for-primary-buttons) and [general modifiers](/components/web/button-and-links/buttons#modifiers) which they share with all buttons).

Our components, or LFUI as sometimes called, can be described as the lego blocks which form the foundation of all digital interfaces we create at Länsförsäkringar.

The design is in sync with our [visual identity](/visual-identity), and standardised ways of using these components together can be found in the [patterns-section](/patterns).

For further information on how our components are presented, see the [Anatomy of a component](#the-anatomy-of-a-component-page).
