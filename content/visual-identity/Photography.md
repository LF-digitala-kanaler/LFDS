## Tonality

We describe our imagery as "cinematic". By this we mean that the images can be perceived as small scenes where each image tells a story and builds a world with a genuine sense of warmth and presence.

People are often at the center of the images, creating recognition and emotional contact. The light in our pictures should be natural and the situations should never be perceived as arranged – all to give an authentic feeling.
