## Tonality

We describe our imagery as "cinematic". By this we mean that the images can be perceived as small scenes where each image tells a story and builds a world with a genuine sense of warmth and presence.

People are often at the center of the images, creating recognition and emotional contact. The light in our pictures should be natural and the situations should never be perceived as arranged – all to give an authentic feeling.

## Pictures that express emotions

One image may not contain every one of these, but common features of our images are that they more or less convey the following emotions:

<div class="content">

A genuine feeling of warmth and closeness, often with the person at the center and situations we can all recognise ourselves in.

Feelings/emotions:\
Warmth, closeness, recognition.

<Collapse title="Commitment and curiosity">
<div class="content">

A world that the viewer wants to be a part of, which radiates commitment, energy and curiosity - something to be inspired by but which can still be seen in oneself.

Feelings/emotions:\
Energy – both subtle and visible, curiosity, inspiration.

Our images play a crucial role in our quest to modernize the perception of our brand. By this we mean the feeling in the pictures but also the motifs themselves.

Feelings/emotions:\
People and motives from a modern perspective. Diversity with all that it entails.
