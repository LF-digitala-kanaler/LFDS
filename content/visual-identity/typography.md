## Use the right type

Our main page headlines are usually set in *LF Rubrik*. The rest of the headlines and most of the typography is set with *Intro cond bold* and in rare cases *Intro Cond Regular*. For paragraps, lists and content in tables use *Arial regular* for optimal readability.

### Variations

For Android and iOS we use Roboto and SFUIDisplay instead of Arial.
