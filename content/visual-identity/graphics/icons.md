  ## Special sizes icons


  These icons are used in specific content today. We try to minimize the use of these special sizes so don't use them in new design.
description: >-
  We want our icons to be informative and easy to understand.

  The icons are less abstract and more specific then the graphic objects. They should support the textual information or cluster information.

  The icons come in various sizes, Each size with variations of details.

## Icons in LFUI

<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlock__right"><div class="ImageBlock__content">

The raw exported files are located in the `icon/src/svg` directory but they are not intended to be used as is. Instead we generate a sprite map and append it to the DOM on page load. If you include `lf.js`you'll get that for free.

We can then have an icon show up anywhere on the page with the svg `<use>.`

```
<svg role="presentation" class="icon" width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="#icon-wallet-20"></use></svg>
```

Our `.icon` class helps with alignment. Note that most icons inherits the `color` CSS property from the parent element in the DOM (using [currentColor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentColor_keyword)).

An icon rarely shows up alone. Together with any text component, be it a link, heading, or paragrah, an icon should have **distance of 10px between itself and the text**. To achieve this, you can use the `.icon-left` if the icon is to be placed to the left of the text, or `.icon-right` for the opposite.</div><div class="ImageBlock__object"><img class="ImageBlock__image" src="undefined" alt="" /></div></div>
