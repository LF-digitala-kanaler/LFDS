#### Geometric and simple

Our graphics take inspiration from our well known symbol. The idea behind the style is to use geometric forms and the strength of our symbol. It´s created by strokes and simple geometric forms. We use our colors; blue, red and white.

These things combined creates a distinct connection to Länsförsäkringar´s visual expression.
