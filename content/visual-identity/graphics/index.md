#### Geometric and simple

Our graphics take inspiration from our well known symbol. The idea behind the style is to use geometric forms and the strength of our symbol. It´s created by strokes and simple geometric forms. We use our colors; blue, red and white.

These things combined creates a distinct connection to Länsförsäkringar´s visual expression.

#### Three simple rules

* Illustrations are used for decoration and brand awareness.
* Graphic objects are a means of communication. Get the message thru! (banners etc)
* Icons are used for visual guidance. They should make information clearer and actions easier.</div><div class="ImageBlock__object"><img class="ImageBlock__image" src="/img/family1-copy.svg" alt="" /></div></div>
